As GraphQL is "self-documenting", we've chosen to use the following tools to render our GraphQL documentaiton. Additionally, as we update the documentation with each deployed feature, you can be sure that these docs are up to date!

## Graphdoc

[https://api.marketplacer.com/graphql/](https://api.marketplacer.com/graphql/)

Graphdoc is a text-based documentation tool that presents the schema in a clean and straightforward mannor. 

## GraphQL Voyager

[https://api.marketplacer.com/graphql-voyager/](https://api.marketplacer.com/graphql-voyager/)

GraphQL Voyager provides a more graphical, interactive view of our docs. Highly reccomended for new uers!
