Adverts in Marketplacer represent an item, such as a bike or a chair. An
advert has one or more [variants](/v2/variants) which represent the different ways an advert
varies. For instance, a bike may come in Black or White colours, which would
mean the advert would have two variants: a White variant and a Black variant.

## List adverts

This endpoint will return a paginated collection of your adverts, as well as their associated brands and taxons.

### Request

    GET /api/v2/client/adverts

You can filter by `external_id` to return only adverts with that `external_id`.

    GET /api/v2/client/adverts?external_id=VALUE

You can also filter to only return adverts whose variants have a particular value for the `sku` or `barcode`.

    GET /api/v2/client/adverts?sku=VALUE

## Create an advert

Creating an advert is a multi-step process

Select the appropriate taxon & brand with the API only.

  1. Find the appropriate taxon and brand slugs by using the [Taxon API](/v2/taxons) and [Brand API](/v2/brands).
  2. Submit the advert to `/api/v2/client/adverts` as below, using the `taxon_slug` and `brand_slug` attributes.

Or, select the appropriate taxon & brand using the client admin in Marketplacer.

  1. Submit the advert to `/api/v2/client/adverts` as below, using the `map_taxon` and `map_brand` attributes.
  2. In the Marketplacer client admin `/client/mappings`, relate these values to the corresponding Marketplacer taxon and brand.

## Updating an advert

Use this endpoint to update any attributes for an advert.

To clear all `feature_option_values` or `secondary_taxons`, assign an empty array.
Not supplying the key for `feature_option_values` or `secondary_taxons` will leave the relevant relationship unchanged.

A request with the key below will remove all `feature_option_values` from the advert and leave `secondary_taxons` unchanged:

```json
{
  relationships: {
    feature_option_values: []
  }
}
```

A request with the key below will remove all `secondary_taxons` from the advert and leave `feature_option_values` unchanged:

```json
{
  relationships: {
    secondary_taxons: []
  }
}
```

A request with the field below won't change either relationship.

```json
{
  relationships: {}
}
```

### Request

    PUT /api/v2/client/adverts/1

### Example

```json
{
  data: {
    attributes: {
      title: "Giant Cypress DX 2014",
      features: { product_features: ["Feature 1", "Feature 2"] }
