---|---
**Advert** | An advert essentially represents a product (or service) for sale on the marketplace. Adverts are placed by sellers.
**Marketplace** | A marketplace brings together sellers and consumers (customers) into 1 place, where both parties can enter into a seller / buyer relationship. Consumers can of course purchase products and services from more that 1 seller.
**Operator** | In the context of the marketplace, the **operator** refers to the organization that runs the marketplace. They are responsible for signing up sellers, attracting consumers and are the "Merchant of Record" for all orders.
**Order** | An order is created once a consumer has selected 1 or more items to purchase from 1 or more sellers, and has transacted payment. Note that an order can contain many line items from multiple sellers.
**Seller** | A Seller represents a business that wishes to sell stuff on the marketplace. A marketplace will typically have multiple sellers.
**Variant** | A variant represents the way a Product (Advert) can _vary_. For example you may be selling a particular pair of training shoes, the variants could represent the sizes and color of those shoes. (When a customer purchases something - they actually purchase the variant)
